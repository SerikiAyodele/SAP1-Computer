2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COMPONENT_3/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COMPONENT_3/W_bus_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell COMPONENT_3/W_bus_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COMPONENT_3/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COMPONENT_3/W_bus_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell COMPONENT_3/W_bus_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COMPONENT_3/Q_tmp_reg[6]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COMPONENT_3/W_in_BR_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell COMPONENT_3/W_in_BR_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COMPONENT_3/T_reg[1][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COMPONENT_3/W_in_MAR_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell COMPONENT_3/W_in_MAR_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COMPONENT_3/T_reg[6][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COMPONENT_3/W_in_ACC_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell COMPONENT_3/W_in_ACC_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
